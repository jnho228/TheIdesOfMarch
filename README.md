# The Ides of March
## Story
The Ides of March have arrived and the Senate is gathering for a meeting. Lead by your long time friend, Brutus, and his brother-in-law Cassius, it was not merely a simple Senate meeting but an assassination plot! Someone takes a stab at you, Imperial Caesar, but you are able to avoid contact. You run out of the Senate building. Your vision is foggy. Assassins are everywhere. How long can you survive?
